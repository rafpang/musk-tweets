## Muskerizer

Developing NLP models and analysis of Elon Musk's tweets from 2010 up until 29 September 2022.

Current objectives/questions:

1. When does he usually tweet?
2. Add sentiments to his tweets using pretrained model

2.1. Is there a trend in the sentiments of Musk's tweets? 
 - Change of sentiments based on time of day
 - Change of average sentiment score over time

3. What are the top words that appear in his tweets?
4. Develop an NLP model to predict the like/retweet count if musk tweeted a user-specified tweet
5. Perhaps some other fun facts about his tweets ?!

Everything will be deployed using streamlit and heroku!
